1. Pre-requisites
-----------------

The information in this file assumes that:

* The SALOME platform is installed to the directory <salome>
* The Hexotic product is installed to the directory <salome>/Hexotic

---------------
2. Installation
---------------

2.1. Unpack HexoticPLUGIN module sources

cd <salome>
tar zxf HexoticPLUGIN_SRC.tgz

2.2. Build HexoticPLUGIN module

* set environment 

bash
cd <salome>
source env_build.sh
export HexoticHOME=<salome>/Hexotic

Note: you can avoid setting HexoticHOME environment variable but use
--with-hexotic key of configure script instead. You can also compile
plugin withour Hexotic product installation. But you'll need to add
path to the hexotic executable to the PATH environment variable in order
to use Hexotic meshing plugin within SALOME.

* configure build system

cd HexoticPLUGIN_SRC
./build_configure

cd ..
mkdir HexoticPLUGIN_BUILD
cd HexoticPLUGIN_BUILD
../HexoticPLUGIN_SRC/configure --prefix=<salome>/HexoticPLUGIN_INSTALL

Note: you can use --with-hexotic option to pass the root directory of
Hexotic product to the configure script. In this case you can avoid
setting HexoticHOME environment variable. Try 'configure --help'
command to learn more about available configure script options.

Check "Summary" area in the log output of the configure script to
verify that all pre-requisites required for the successful compilation
of HexoticPLUFIN module have been found. All pre-requisite products
should have status "yes". If any product has status "no", the
compilation procedure will fail (the only exception is Hexotic
product which is not required for the successful compilation of the
plugin; it is needed in run-time only).

* compile and install plugin module 

make
make install

exit

If the compilation is finished successfully (make and make install
steps are finished without errors) the HexoticPLUGIN meshing module
should be installed in the directory <salome>/HexoticPLUGIN_INSTALL.

-----------------------------------
3. Launch SALOME with HexoticPLUGIN
-----------------------------------

* set environment

bash
cd <salome>
source env_products.sh

export HEXOTICPLUGIN_ROOT_DIR=<salome>/HexoticPLUGIN_INSTALL
export SalomeAppConfig=${HEXOTICPLUGIN_ROOT_DIR}/share/salome/resources/hexoticplugin
export PATH=<salome>/Hexotic:${PATH

* run SALOME

runSalome

-----------------------------
4. HexoticPLUGIN plugin usage
-----------------------------

* Create new study

* Activate Geometry module and create simple geometry object

* Activate Mesh module

* Invoke menu "Mesh/Create Mesh"

* Select previously created geometry object by clicking it with the
mouse in the Object Browser

* In the "Create mesh" dialog box:
- activate "3D" page
- In the "Algorithm" combo box select "Hexotic"
- Click on the button at the right of the "Hypothesis" combo box and
select "Hexotic parameters" item in the drop-down menu

* In the "Hypothesis Construction" dialog box set parameters of Hexotic
  meshing algorithm and click "OK" button

* In the "Create mesh" dialog box Click "Apply & Close" button to
  define mesh and close the dialog box

* In the Object Browser select "Mesh_1" object, invoke context popup
menu for it by clicking right mouse button and select "Compute" item

The resulting mesh created with Hexotic plugin will be shown in the 3D
viewer.
