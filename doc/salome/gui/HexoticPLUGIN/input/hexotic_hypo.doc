<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - allows to define the name of the hypothesis (Hexotic 
Parameters by default).</li>

<li><b>Min size</b> - allows defining the minimal size of the elements (overrides "Nb. Hexes Max Level" value).</li>

<li><b>Max size</b> - allows defining the maximal size of the elements (overrides "Nb. Hexes Min Level" value).</li>

<li><b>Nb. Hexes Min Level</b> - allows defining the minimal level of recursive partitioning on the initial octree cube.</li>

<li><b>Nb. Hexes Max Level</b> - allows defining the maximal level of recursive partitioning on the initial octree cube.</li>

<li><b>Generate smooth meshes no ridges</b> - specifies that the mesher can ignore ridges. A ridge is a geometrical entity (a sharp edge). The resulting meshes will have better quality elements, at the price of "smoothing" out the geometry.
</li>

<li><b>Authorize invalid elements</b> - specifies that the mesher must conform as much as possible to the geometry (especially the sharp edges). The resulting meshes may contain invalid elements (but with positive volumes: for example, three vertices of an hexahedron on the same edge), for the benefit of better geometry accuracy.
</li>

<li><b>Sharp angle threshold in degrees</b> - specifies the angle between two triangles above which the hex mesher will consider the edge common to these two triangles as being a "ridge". A ridge is a geometrical entity (a sharp edge) which has to be kept as it is in the final hex mesh.The default value is 60 (degrees).<br>If you raise this value, the hex mesher will detect less ridges, and the final solid mesh will therefore be smoother. On the other hand, if you reduce this value, more ridges will be detected and the algorithm will face harder situations to conform to.
</li>

<li><b>Number of threads</b> - specifies the number of threads to be used (this should be the number of cores or processors of a shared memory parallel architecture).
</li>

<li><b>Working directory</b> - specifies the directory where the input/output files will be created.
</li>

<li><b>Verbosity</b> - specifies the verbose level to print information on meshing steps.
</li>

<li><b>Max memory (MB)</b> - specifies the maximum allocatable memory in MegaBytes.
</li>

<li><b>Sub-domains mesh mode</b> - This option allows the user to mesh or not mesh internal subdomains (such as holes), or to mesh non-manifold domains.
<ul>
<li>sd 1 : meshes in inside/out mode: the internal cavities are ignored, the whole domain is meshed into a single domain;</li>
<li>sd 2 : meshes only the internal main component. Internal holes (cavities) will not be meshed;</li>
<li>sd 3 : meshes all cavities and generates subdomains accordingly;</li>
<li>sd 4 : meshes non-manifold geometries as such and generates subdomains accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

\note If BLSURF is used as 2D algo, and if a GMF file is defined as output file (using SetGMFFile(my2Dmesh.mesh)), then Hexotic will use this file as input.
This allows to avoid the reconstruction of the GMF file from the SMESH structure and can improve the global computation time.
